## How to use

### Chrome extension: easy but flaky

TODO: link to chrome extension, say navigate to page then press browser action button

### Add a plugin to your babel build

TODO: explain how to install
- npm install babel plugin
- include it in babelrc or similar
- add script tag

#### Tracking only specific objects to save memory

TODO

#### (Maybe mention including it as separate file rather than as import, better for perf of devtools/source maps)
